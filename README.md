# hello-world
Just testing a repository

I'm doing the github "Hello World" guide. Now I am at the commit step.

A few years ago, I was attending an IT university, but I had to stop because I had no focus on it. Now my interest in coding is coming back with the possibility of coding for Adobe Premiere and After Effects using JavaScript.
